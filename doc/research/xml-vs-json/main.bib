Therefore in this paper we propose a formal data model for JSON documents and, based on the common features present in available systems using JSON, we define a lightweight query language allowing us to navigate through JSON documents. We also introduce a logic capturing the schema proposal for JSON and study the complexity of basic computational tasks associated with these two formalisms.},

abstract = {Software technology for algorithm visualization (AV) has advanced faster than our understanding of how such technology impacts student learning. In this paper we present results of a multi-university study. We measured the effect of varying levels of student engagement with AV to learn simple sorting algorithms. These levels included: 1) not seeing any visualization, 2) simply viewing visualizations for a short period in the classroom, and 3) interacting directly with the visualizations for an extended period outside of the classroom. Our results show that learning increases as the level of student engagement increases. AV has a bigger impact on learning when students go beyond merely viewing a visualization and are required to engage in additional activities structured around the visualization. In particular, students who responded to questions integrated into the AV tool during their exploration of an algorithm showed the most improvement between a pretest and posttest.},

abstract = {Algorithm visualization (AV) technology graphically illustrates how algorithms work. Despite the intuitive appeal of the technology, it has failed to catch on in mainstream computer science education. Some have attributed this failure to the mixed results of experimental studies designed to substantiate AV technology's educational effectiveness. However, while several integrative reviews of AV technology have appeared, none has focused specifically on the software's effectiveness by analyzing this body of experimental studies as a whole. In order to better understand the effectiveness of AV technology, we present a systematic meta-study of 24 experimental studies. We pursue two separate analyses: an analysis ofindependent variables , in which we tie each study to a particular guiding learning theory in an attempt to determine which guiding theory has had the most predictive success; and an analysis of dependent variables, which enables us to determine which measurement techniques have been most sensitive to the learning benefits of AV technology. Our most significant finding is that how students use AV technology has a greater impact on effectiveness than what AV technology shows them. Based on our findings, we formulate an agenda for future research into AV effectiveness.}

Whereas Price's taxonomy is directed to classifying features and characteristics of visualization systems, the new taxonomy focuses on evaluating current animation languages. The taxonomy can be used by algorithm visualization system designers as a tool to compare visualization system languages with each other as well as for designing and implementing new systems and language features. In addition, the taxonomy provides guidelines to the features that are needed for transferring animations between systems. This is an ongoing project that elaborates upon the work reported on in a briefer version of the taxonomy.}

We argue that such technology, no matter how well it is designed, is of little educational value unless it engages learners in an active learning activity. Drawing on a review of experimental studies of visualization effectiveness, we motivate this position against the backdrop of current attitudes and best practices with respect to visualization use. We suggest a new taxonomy of learner engagement with visualization technology. Grounded in Bloom's well-recognized taxonomy of understanding, we suggest metrics for assessing the learning outcomes to which such engagement may lead. Based on these taxonomies of engagement and effectiveness metrics, we present a framework for experimental studies of visualization effectiveness. Interested computer science educators are invited to collaborate with us by carrying out studies within this framework.},
