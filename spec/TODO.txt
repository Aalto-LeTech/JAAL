- data examples for graph
  - linked list with payload
    * payload is another node which is referenced by id in the linked list
      node as property "value" (right?)
  - binary tree without payload
  - undirected graph
  - undirected, weighted graph
  etc...

Eventually all JAAL should support all the data structures in Trak Y JSAV
exercises.
