- data examples for graph
  - linked list with payload
    * payload is another node which is referenced by id in the linked list
      node as property "value" (right?)
    - undirected graph
  - undirected, weighted graph
  - Finger tree
  - kd tree

- whole JAAL recordings
  - insertion sort
  - Dijkstra's algorithm

Eventually all JAAL should support all the data structures in Trak Y JSAV
exercises.
