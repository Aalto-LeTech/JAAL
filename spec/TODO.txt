- data examples for graph
  * Requirement 70: there must be a language structure for a
    key-value pair. A B-tree node contains an array of key-value pairs, NOT
    separate arrays for keys and values.
  - add key type reference to: graph, matrix, node
  - remove attributeList, because it is easier to just add custom fields
    into other objects of other schemas
  - B-tree &
  - Finger tree
  - kd tree
  - linked list with payload
    * payload is another node which is referenced by id in the linked list
      node as property "value" (right?)
    - undirected graph


- whole JAAL recordings
  - insertion sort
  - Dijkstra's algorithm

Eventually all JAAL should support all the data structures in Trak Y JSAV
exercises.

doc/jaal-schema-documentation.md: why [array of] key-value pairs is more
generalizable than separate arrays of keys and values? B-tree, vp-tree, kd-tree,
finger tree?
